# SHAPEAI BOTCAMP ON PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. <br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Machine Learning

<br>During these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:

In multiple regression, we predicting dependent variable from two or more independent variables e.g. predicting height from weight and age. Linear regression implies that the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables is linear and thus can be described by a linear plane known as the regression plane. We are in the process of finding a regression plane that fits the maximum number of data points.
  
**USE CASE**

The boston dataset is builtin in sklearn library. There are 13 independent features. The model is evaluated on MSE and R square metrics. MSE is 27.19 and R square is 0.52921.The <a
